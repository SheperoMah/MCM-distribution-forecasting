# MCM.py is a collection of functions for the Markov-chain
# Mixture Distribution model for forecasting. 
#
# The model was published in:
# [1] J. Munkhammar&J. WidÃ©n, Probabilistic forecasting of high-resolution 
# clear-sky index time-series using a Markov-chain mixture distribution 
# model, Solar Energy vol XX 2019. (Available as preprint on Researchgate)
#
# Any use of this model should cite the reference and state that this model
# was used.
#
# This file contains the following functions:
#
# P = MCMFit(Data,N) which determines an NxN transition matrix P from a 
# time-series in Data.
#
# X, Y = MCMForecast(P,a,b,obspoint) which delivers a piece-wise uniform
# distribution (X,Y) from the transition matrix P, minimum a and maximum b
# of the time-series and obspoint as the observation point to forecast
# from.
#
# NewSamples = MCMRnd(X,Y,Num) which delivers Num number of samples of the
# distribution X,Y (obtained in MCMForecast), which is the predictive 
# distribution (the forecast).
#
# These functions can all be tested using MCMtest.py, which is accompanied
# by a test data set TestData.txt
