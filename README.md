# MCM distribution forecasting
MCM.py is a collection of functions for the Markov-chain Mixture 
Distribution model for forecasting developed by  
Dr. Joakim Munkhammar, Ph.D., Uppsala University 2019.
Mahmoud Shepero at Uppsala University is also acknowledged as 
assisting in the code development.

The model was published in:

[1] J. Munkhammar & J. Wid√©n, Probabilistic forecasting of high-resolution 
clear-sky index time-series using a Markov-chain mixture distribution 
model, Solar Energy vol XX 2019. (Available as preprint on Researchgate)
