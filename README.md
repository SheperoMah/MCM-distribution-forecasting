# MCM distribution forecasting
MCM.py is a collection of functions for the Markov-chain Mixture 
Distribution model for forecasting developed by  
Dr. Joakim Munkhammar, Ph.D., Uppsala University 2019.
Mahmoud Shepero at Uppsala University is also acknowledged as 
assisting in the code development.

The model was published in:
